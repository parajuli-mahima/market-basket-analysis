# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on data analysis and model building using Python.
The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis,
and evaluation of results to gain meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Dataset
- Structured dataset in CSV format
- Used for analysis and predictive modeling
- Preprocessing steps applied to handle missing values and features

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature selection and scaling
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Result interpretation

## Outcome
The project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can be used
to analyze datasets and extract useful insights.

## Future Improvements
- Try advanced models
- Improve feature engineering
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
